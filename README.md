This GitHub repository is for the RAI REACT project – REsponsible and Adaptive robots in Complex seTtings, where we share resources, project deliverables, and updates on our progress.

Healthcare systems globally are experiencing increasing demand, especially as people live longer and require more complex care. This creates a need for innovative solutions. This project is developing novel approaches for integrating adaptive multi-human multirobot (MHMR) systems into complex social environments, specifically in healthcare settings. The team held their first public workshop on 22 January 2025, seeking to understand the public’s thoughts on recent robotic developments and give direct input into how adaptive multi-human multi-robot systems might be implemented into care home settings in the future. As healthcare needs grow, adaptive robots could offer an innovative solution.
